# 🔍 Duplicate Cleaner Pro

A powerful, intelligent duplicate file finder and cleaner with advanced image similarity detection and professional GUI interface.

## 🚀 Features

## 🔎 **Smart Duplicate Detection**

- Exact Duplicates: MD5 hash-based detection for identical files

- Similar Images: Perceptual hashing to find resized, cropped, or slightly modified images

- Video Duplicates: Comprehensive video file comparison

- Adjustable Similarity: Customizable threshold (80%-100%) for similarity matching

## 🖼️ Intelligent Classification

- Screenshot Detection: Automatically identifies and categorizes screenshots

- Multi-Format Support: Handles images (JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WebP) and videos (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, etc.)

- Recursive Scanning: Optional deep folder scanning with subfolder support

## 🛡️ Safe Operations

- Backup System: Automatic backup creation before any file operations

- Smart Preferences: Keep newest, oldest, largest, or smallest files

- Confirmation Dialogs: Multiple safety confirmations for destructive operations

- Detailed Logging: Comprehensive operation logs with timestamps

## 🎨 Professional Interface

## 💡 Why I Built This

Existing duplicate cleaners were either:

💰 Expensive with subscription models

🔒 Limited in functionality

🚫 Unsafe with no backup options

🎯 Generic without customization

So I built exactly what I needed - a free, powerful, safe, and customizable solution that anyone can use and modify.
